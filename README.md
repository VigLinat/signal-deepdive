# A Deep Dive into Signal Protocol

Source: https://signal.org/docs/

A deep dive into the messaging protocol of Signal messenger with educational
purposes.

The 'Signal-Protocol-Overview.drawio.png' contains a diagram of Signal
protocol, that is build up from several whitepapers (e.g. 'X3DH' and 'Double
Ratchet').

All drawings are my own, or borrowed from original Signal whitepapers which in
turn are marked respectively (with Signal Logo Ultramarine). Source link to
original whitepapers preseneted at the head of this document.
